This repo is working on FacebookResearch/Segment-anything.

Currently is transpose the python code into Cpp version only with opencv&onnx lib.

I will update the repo after finishing each module of this model.

If anyone hope to use this repo, only to sudo apt-get install opencv and install onnxruntime C++ lib in your local environment.

Best.
